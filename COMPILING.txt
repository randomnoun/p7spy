p7spy requires a cygwin installation, and a Java 1.4 and 1.6 JDK. 
It was developed using Eclipse 3.4.2, so if you wish to use the .project files to compile 
this application, you should probably download these from:

  Cygwin:  http://www.cygwin.com/
  Eclipse: http://www.eclipse.org/
    
To compile, open this project in eclipse, right-click on the build.xml file, select 
'Run As'->'Ant build', select the 'all' task and click OK.

This will create a 'p7spy.jar' in the build/jar folder. 

Run the net.sf.p7spy.test.P7SpyTest class to see it in action.

This distribution includes artifacts from the following open source projects.

@TODO list these, and their licenses.
